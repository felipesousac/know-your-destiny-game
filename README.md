This is a simple project that was made during the Maratona Explorer bootcamp by rocketseat.

I did some changes in the original project: implemented a dark mode toggle that saves the user preference for the next time that the user visits the website; make the "enter" key a trigger to the main button of the application and did some changes aiming the security of the application, for example, a XSS attack when innerHTML is used.
